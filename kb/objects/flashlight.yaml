# Flashlight Object Type Definition
#
# This defines a basic flashlight with a switch, bulb, and battery.
# It demonstrates core concepts like binary states (on/off) and 
# qualitative levels (empty/low/med/high).
#
# Key behaviors modeled:
# - Switch controls bulb state
# - Battery drains when light is on
# - Light won't turn on if battery is empty

attributes:
  # Physical switch that can be toggled
  switch:
    space: ["off", "on"]       # Binary state space
    mutable: true              # Can be changed by actions
    default: "off"             # Starts in off position

  # Light bulb that illuminates when powered
  bulb:
    space: ["off", "on"]       # Binary state space
    mutable: true              # Controlled by switch state
    default: "off"             # Starts off (follows switch)

  # Battery charge level using qualitative values
  battery_level:
    space: ["empty", "low", "med", "high"]  # Ordered qualitative levels
    mutable: true              # Decreases over time/use
    default: "med"             # Starts with medium charge
