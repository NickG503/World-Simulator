# Electric Kettle Object Type Definition
#
# This defines an electric kettle that heats water. It demonstrates
# qualitative temperature progression and the relationship between
# power state and heating processes.
#
# Key behaviors modeled:
# - Power switch controls heating element
# - Temperature increases when powered and water is present
# - Water level affects heating efficiency
# - Safety: won't heat when empty (future constraint)

type: kettle
version: 1

attributes:
  # Power switch for the heating element
  power:
    space: ["off", "on"]       # Binary power state
    mutable: true              # Can be toggled by user
    default: "off"             # Starts unpowered for safety

  # Water temperature using qualitative levels
  temperature:
    space: ["cold", "warm", "hot", "boiling"]  # Progressive heating states
    mutable: true              # Changes based on power and time
    default: "cold"            # Starts at room temperature

  # Amount of water in the kettle
  water_level:
    space: ["empty", "low", "mid", "full"]     # Qualitative volume levels
    mutable: true              # Can be filled/emptied
    default: "mid"             # Starts partially filled
