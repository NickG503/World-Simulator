# Set Power Action for Electric Kettle
#
# This action controls the kettle's power switch. It's a simple
# binary control action that demonstrates basic parameter validation
# and direct attribute assignment.
#
# Behavior:
# - Sets power switch to the requested position (on/off)
# - When powered on, heating will begin (handled by environment rules in Phase 4)
# - No immediate temperature change (realistic delay)

action: set_power
object_type: kettle

parameters:
  # Target power state
  to:
    space: ["off", "on"]      # Must be valid power state

preconditions:
  # Parameter validation
  - 'to in ["off","on"]'      # Ensure valid target state
  
  # Note: Future versions might add safety checks like:
  # - 'to == "on" -> water_level != "empty"'  # Don't heat empty kettle

effects:
  # Primary effect: set power to requested state
  - 'power = to'
  
  # Note: Temperature changes will be handled by environment rules
  # in Phase 4, which will gradually increase temperature when
  # power is on and water is present.
